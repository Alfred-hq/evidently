## What is Evidently?

Evidently helps analyze and track data and ML model quality throughout the model lifecycle. You can think of it as an evaluation layer that fits into the existing ML stack.

Evidently has a modular approach with 3 interfaces on top of the shared `analyzer` functionality. 

# 1. Interactive visual reports 

![Dashboard example](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently/blob/main/docs/images/evidently_4_reports_preview_small.png)

Evidently generates interactive `dashboards` from pandas `DataFrame` or `csv` files. You can use them for model evaluation, debugging and documentation. 

Each report covers a particular aspect of the model performance. You can display reports in Jupyter notebook or Colab or export as an HTML file. Currently 6 pre-built reports are available:
* **[Data Drift]**(https://docs.evidentlyai.com/reports/data-drift). Detects changes in the input feature distribution. 
* **Target Drift**: [Numerical](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/reports/num-target-drift), [Categorical](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/reports/categorical-target-drift). Detects changes in the model output.
* **Model Performance**: [Classification](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/reports/classification-performance), [Probabilistic Classification](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/reports/probabilistic-classification-performance), [Regression](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/reports/reg-performance). Evaluates the quality of the model and model errors.

# 2. Data and ML model profiling 

Evidently also generates JSON `profiles`. You can use them to integrate the data or model evaluation step into the ML pipeline. 

You can log and store JSON profiles for further analysis, or build a conditional workflow based on the result of the check (e.g. to trigger alert, retraining, or generate a visual report). The profiles calculate the same metrics and statistical tests as visual reports. 

You can explore example integrations with tools like Airflow and Mlflow.

# 3. Real-time ML monitoring 
**Note**: this functionality is in active development and subject to API change.
![Dashboard example](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently/blob/main/docs/images/evidently_data_drift_grafana_dashboard_top.png)

Evidently has `monitors` that collect the data and model metrics from a deployed ML service. You can use it to build live monitoring dashboards. Evidently configures the monitoring on top of the streaming data and emits the metrics. You can log and use the metrics elsewhere. 

There is a lightweight integration with Prometheus and Grafana that comes with pre-built dashboards.

## Installing from PyPI
### MAC OS and Linux
Evidently is available as a PyPI package. To install it using pip package manager, run:
```sh
$ pip install evidently
```

The tool allows building interactive reports both inside a Jupyter notebook and as a separate HTML file. If you only want to generate interactive reports as HTML files or export as JSON profiles, the installation is now complete.

To enable building interactive reports inside a Jupyter notebook, we use jupyter nbextension. If you want to create reports inside a Jupyter notebook, then after installing `evidently` you should run the two following commands in the terminal from evidently directory.

To install jupyter nbextension, run:
```sh
$ jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py evidently
```
To enable it, run:
```sh
$ jupyter nbextension enable evidently --py --sys-prefix
```
That's it!

**Note**: a single run after the installation is enough. No need to repeat the last two commands every time.

**Note 2**: if you use Jupyter Lab, you may experience difficulties with exploring report inside a Jupyter notebook. However, the report generation in a separate .html file will work correctly.

### Windows
Evidently is available as a PyPI package. To install it using pip package manager, run:
```sh
$ pip install evidently
```
The tool allows building interactive reports both inside a Jupyter notebook and as a separate HTML file. Unfortunately, building reports inside a Jupyter notebook is not yet possible for Windows. The reason is Windows requires administrator privileges to create symlink. In later versions we will address this issue.

## Getting started

### Jupyter Notebook
To start, prepare your data as two pandas `DataFrames`. The first should include your reference data, the second - current production data.Â The structure of both datasets should be identical. 

* For **Data Drift** report, include the input features only.
* For **Target Drift** reports, include the column with Target and/or Prediction.
* For **Model Performance** reports, include the columns with Target and Prediction.

Calculation results can be available in one of the two formats:
* Option 1: an interactive **Dashboard** displayed inside the Jupyter notebook or exportable as a HTML report.
* Option 2: a JSON **Profile** that includes the values of metrics and the results of statistical tests.  

#### Option 1: Dashboard

After installing the tool, import Evidently **dashboard** and required tabs:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets

from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
from evidently.dashboard.tabs import (
    DataDriftTab,
    CatTargetDriftTab
)

iris = datasets.load_iris()
iris_frame = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns = iris.feature_names)
iris_frame['target'] = iris.target
```

To generate the **Data Drift** report, run:
```python
iris_data_drift_report = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab()])
iris_data_drift_report.calculate(iris_frame[:100], iris_frame[100:], column_mapping = None)
iris_data_drift_report.save("reports/my_report.html")
```

To generate the **Data Drift** and the **Categorical Target Drift** reports, run:
```python
iris_data_and_target_drift_report = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab(), CatTargetDriftTab()])
iris_data_and_target_drift_report.calculate(iris_frame[:100], iris_frame[100:], column_mapping = None)
iris_data_and_target_drift_report.save("reports/my_report_with_2_tabs.html")
```

If you get a security alert, press "trust html".
HTML report does not open automatically. To explore it, you should open it from the destination folder.

#### Option 2: Profile

After installing the tool, import Evidently **profile** and required sections:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets

from evidently.model_profile import Profile
from evidently.model_profile.sections import (
    DataDriftProfileSection,
    CatTargetDriftProfileSection
)

iris = datasets.load_iris()
iris_frame = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns = iris.feature_names)
```

To generate the **Data Drift** profile, run:
```python
iris_data_drift_profile = Profile(sections=[DataDriftProfileSection()])
iris_data_drift_profile.calculate(iris_frame, iris_frame, column_mapping = None)
iris_data_drift_profile.json() 
```

To generate the **Data Drift** and the **Categorical Target Drift** profile, run:
```python
iris_target_and_data_drift_profile = Profile(sections=[DataDriftProfileSection(), CatTargetDriftProfileSection()])
iris_target_and_data_drift_profile.calculate(iris_frame[:75], iris_frame[75:], column_mapping = None) 
iris_target_and_data_drift_profile.json() 
```
## Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel, Deepnote

<details><summary>Read instruction to run Evidently in other notebook environments.</summary>
<p>

You can run ```evidently``` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code) and [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/).

First, install ```evidently```. Run the following command in the notebook cell:
```!pip install evidently```

There is no need to enable nbextension for this case, because ```evidently``` uses an alternative way to display visuals in the hosted notebooks.

To build a ```Dashboard``` or a ```Profile``` simply repeat the steps described in the previous paragraph. For example, to build the **Data Drift** dashboard, run:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets

from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
from evidently.dashboard.tabs import DataDriftTab

iris = datasets.load_iris()
iris_frame = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns = iris.feature_names)

iris_data_drift_report = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab()])
iris_data_drift_report.calculate(iris_frame[:100], iris_frame[100:], column_mapping = None)
```

To display the dashboard in the Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel, Deepnote, run:
```python
iris_data_drift_report.show()
```

The ```show()``` method has the argument ```mode```, which can take the following options:

* **auto** - the default option. Ideally, you will not need to specify the value for ```mode``` and use the default. But, if it does not work (in case we failed to determine the environment automatically), consider setting the correct value explicitly.
* **nbextension** - to show the UI using nbextension. Use this option to display dashboards in Jupyter notebooks (it should work automatically).
* **inline** - to insert the UI directly into the cell. Use this option for PyLab, Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels and Deepnote. For Google Colab, this should work automatically, for **PyLab**, **Kaggle Kernels** and **Deepnote** the option should be specified explicitly.
