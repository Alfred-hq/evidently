# Monitoring

Evidently has a configurable monitoring service component that can collect metrics from an ML service.

It is currently recommended to use it together with Prometheus (to store metrics) and Grafana (to display dashboards and manage alerts). There are a set of pre-built Grafana dashboards on the base of the Evidently reports. 

Explore the integration page for further details:
