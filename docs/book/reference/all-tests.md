description: List of all tests available in Evidently.

How to read the tables:

* **Test**: the name of an individual test that you can include in a Test Suite. If a test has an optional parameter, we'll include an example. 
* **Level**: whether the test applies to the whole dataset or individual columns. Note that you can still apply column-level tests to all the columns in the dataset.
* **Description**: plain text explanation of how the test works.
* **Default**: plain text explanation of the default parameters. Many tests have two types of defaults. The first applies when you pass a reference dataset and Evidently can derive expectations from this baseline. The second applies if you do not provide the reference. You can always override the defaults by specifying a custom condition.   

We organize the tests into logical groups. Note that the groups do not match the presets with the same name, e.g., there are more Data Quality tests below than in the DataQuality preset.

## Data integrity

Note: the tests that evaluate the number or share of nulls detect four types of nulls by default: Pandas nulls (None, NAN, etc.), "" (empty string), Numpy "-inf" value, Numpy "inf" value. You can also pass a custom list of nulls as a parameter and specify if you want to replace the default list. Example:

```python
TestNumberOfNulls(null_values=["", 0, "n/a", -9999, None], replace=True)
```
