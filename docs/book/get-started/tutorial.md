# Getting Started Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will use Evidently to generate profiles and visual reports on data drift and model performance. You can reproduce the steps in Jupyter notebooks or Colab. 

We suggest going through this tutorial once to understand the key tool functionality on a toy dataset. Once you‚Äôve completed it, you can further explore more advanced features such as customization and setting up real-time monitoring. 

To complete the tutorial, you need basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with notebook environments. You should be able to complete it in under 10 minutes.

If you prefer a **video** version, here is a **10-min Quick Start** on how to generate Data and Target Drift reports and JSON profiles in the Jupyter notebook.

In this tutorial, we will go through the following steps for Jupyter notebook and Colab:
*Install Evidently
*Prepare the data
*Understand output formats
*Generate data drift dashboards 
*Generate prediction drift dashboards 
*Generate model performance dashboards  
*Generate JSON profiles  

 
## 1. Install Evidently

### MAC OS and Linux

To install Evidently using the pip package manager, run:

```bash
$ pip install evidently
```
If you want to see reports inside a Jupyter notebook, you need to also install the Jupyter **nbextension**. After installing `evidently`, run the **two following commands** in the terminal from the Evidently directory.

To install jupyter nbextension, run:

```
$ jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py evidently
```

To enable it, run:

```
$ jupyter nbextension enable evidently --py --sys-prefix
```

That's it!

### Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel, Deepnote


To install `evidently`, run the following command in the notebook cell:

```
!pip install evidently
```
### Windows

Unfortunately, building reports inside a **Jupyter notebook** is **not yet possible** for Windows. You can still install Evidently and use it to generate reports as a separate HTML file.

To install Evidently, run:

```bash
$ pip install evidently
```

## 2. Import Evidently

After installing the tool, import `evidently` and the required tabs. Each tab corresponds to a specific report type. In this example, you'd use 3 different reports. 

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets

from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
from evidently.dashboard.tabs import (
    DataDriftTab,
    CatTargetDriftTab,
    ProbClassificationPerformanceTab,
)
```

## 3. Prepare the data

In this example, you will work with `pandas.DataFrames`. For simplicity, we take a toy dataset. In real use case, you can swap it for the real logs with input data and/or model predictions.  

Create a `Pandas DataFrame` with the dataset to analyze:

```python
iris = datasets.load_iris()
iris_frame = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns = iris.feature_names)
```
To evaluate things like data drift, you would need two datasets. The first one is the baseline: this can often be the data used in training. We call it **reference** data. The second dataset is the **current** production data. 

You can use two separate datasets with identical schema. In this example, we proceed with one dataset but explicitly **identify rows** that refer to reference and production data.



Work in progress

--- 
Model Performance reports can be generated for a **single** dataset, with no comparison performed. You can simply pass a single `DataFrame`or `csv` file.&#x20;

The data structure is different depending on the report type.

* For the **Data Drift** report, include the input features only.&#x20;
* For the **Target Drift** reports, include the input features and the column with the Target and/or the Prediction.&#x20;
* For the **Model Performance** reports, include the input features, the column with the Target, and the column with the Prediction.

If you include more columns than needed for a given report, they will be ignored. &#x20;

## Decide on the output format

Calculation results can be available in one of the following formats:

* An interactive visual **Dashboard** displayed inside the Jupyter notebook.
* An exportable **HTML report**. The same as dashboard, but standalone.&#x20;
* A **JSON profile** with a summary of metrics and statistical test results.&#x20;

**Dashboards** are best for ad-hoc analysis, debugging, and team sharing.

**Profiles** are best for integration into prediction pipelines or with external visualization tools.

You can proceed to work with Jupyter notebook or generate JSON profiles and HTML reports via Terminal.

| Output format    | Jupyter notebook | Terminal |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| **Dashboard**    | +                | -        |
| **HTML report**  | +                | +        |
| **JSON profile** | +                | +        |

All options are described below.

## Jupyter notebook&#x20;

### Generating dashboards and HTML reports





`Dashboard` generates an interactive report that includes the selected `Tabs`.&#x20;

You can choose the following **Tabs**:

* `DataDriftTab` to estimate the **data drift**
* `NumTargetDriftTab` to estimate **target drift** for the numerical **** target&#x20;
* `CatTargetDriftTab` to estimate **target drift** for the categorical target&#x20;
* `RegressionPerformanceTab` to explore the **performance** of a regression model
* `ClassificationPerformanceTab` to explore the **performance** of a classification **** model
* `ProbClassificationPerformanceTab` to explore the **performance** of a probabilistic classification model&#x20;

To generate the **Data Drift** report and save it as HTML, run:

```python
iris_data_drift_report = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab])
iris_data_drift_report.calculate(iris_frame[:75], iris_frame[75:], 
    column_mapping = None)
iris_data_drift_report.save("reports/my_report.html")
```

To generate the **Data Drift** and the **Categorical Target Drift** reports, first add a target (and/or prediction) column to the initial dataset:&#x20;

```python
iris_frame['target'] = iris.target
```

Then run:

```python
iris_data_and_target_drift_report = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab, CatTargetDriftTab])
iris_data_and_target_drift_report.calculate(iris_frame[:75], iris_frame[75:], 
    column_mapping=None)
iris_data_and_target_drift_report.save("reports/my_report_with_2_tabs.html")
```

If you get a security alert, press "trust html". The HTML report does not open automatically. To explore it, you should open it from the destination folder.

To generate the **Classification Model Performance report**, run:

```python
classification_performance_report = Dashboard(tabs=[ClassificationPerformanceTab])
classification_performance_report.calculate(reference_data, current_data, 
    column_mapping=column_mapping)
classification_performance_report.show()
```

For **Probabilistic Classification Model Performance report**, run:

```python
classification_performance_report = Dashboard(tabs=[ProbClassificationPerformanceTab])
classification_performance_report.calculate(reference_data, current_data, 
    column_mapping=column_mapping)
classification_performance_report.show()
```

For a **classification reports** from a single `DataFrame`, run:

```python
classification_single_model_performance = Dashboard(tabs=[ClassificationPerformanceTab])
classification_single_model_performance.calculate(reference_data, None, 
    column_mapping=column_mapping) 
classification_single_model_performance.show()
```

For a **probabilistic classification report** from a single `DataFrame`, run:

```python
prob_classification_single_model_performance = Dashboard(tabs=[ProbClassificationPerformanceTab])
prob_classification_single_model_performance.calculate(reference_data, None, 
    column_mapping=column_mapping)
prob_classification_single_model_performance.show()
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**It might take some time to display the report. If it does not show, this might be due to the dataset size.** The dashboard contains the data necessary to generate interactive plots and can become large. The limitation depends on infrastructure. In this case, we suggest applying sampling to your dataset. In Jupyter notebook, that can be done directly with pandas. You can also generate a JSON profile instead üëáüèº

## Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel, Deepnote

You can run `evidently` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code) and [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com).

First, install `evidently`. Run the following command in the notebook cell:

```
!pip install evidently
```

There is no need to enable nbextension for this case. Evidently uses an alternative way to display visuals in the hosted notebooks.

To build a `Dashboard` or a `Profile` simply repeat the steps described in the previous paragraph. For example, to build the **Data Drift** dashboard, run:

```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets

from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
from evidently.dashboard.tabs import DataDriftTab

iris = datasets.load_iris()
iris_frame = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns = iris.feature_names)

iris_data_drift_report = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab])
iris_data_drift_report.calculate(iris_frame[:100], iris_frame[100:], column_mapping = None)
```

To display the dashboard in the Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel, Deepnote, run:

```
iris_data_drift_report.show()
```

The `show()` method has the argument `mode`, which can take the following options:

* **auto** - the default option. Ideally, you will not need to specify the value for `mode` and use the default. But, if it does not work (in case we failed to determine the environment automatically), consider setting the correct value explicitly.
* **nbextension** - to show the UI using nbextension. Use this option to display dashboards in Jupyter notebooks (it should work automatically).
* **inline** - to insert the UI directly into the cell. Use this option for Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels and Deepnote. For Google Colab, this should work automatically, for **Kaggle Kernels** and **Deepnote** the option should be specified explicitly.

Understand all reports.

You can later refere to the Dashboard and Profile pages that sum up all the functionality.
