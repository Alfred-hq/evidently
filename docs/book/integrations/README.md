# Integrations

Evidently can be easily integrated with other tools to fit into the existing workflows.&#x20;

Below are a few specific examples of how to integrate Evidently in the prediction pipelines. You can adapt them for other workflow management, visualization, and tracking tools.

### 1. Real-time ML monitoring with Grafana

{% content-ref url="evidently-and-grafana.md" %}
[evidently-and-grafana.md](evidently-and-grafana.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 2. Data and ML model checks with Airflow

{% content-ref url="evidently-and-airflow.md" %}
[evidently-and-airflow.md](evidently-and-airflow.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 3. Log Evidently metrics in MLflow UI

{% content-ref url="evidently-and-mlflow.md" %}
[evidently-and-mlflow.md](evidently-and-mlflow.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
